    A) motAsp: indicates the rotational velocity of the steering wheel.
       The value ranges typical in the interval [-150, 150].
    B) motAsp_Qual: during nominal operation motAsp_Qual is constant 2f
       a value of 0f was observed briefly during failure instant
    C) tsuTrq: indicates the torque exerted by the driver.
       the value ranges in the interval [-8, 8].
       When the driver does not touch the steering wheel, the value is
       close to 0.
       A positive value indicates a drag to the left, ccw.
       A negative value indicates a drag to the right, clockwise.
    D) tsuTrq_qual: during nominal operation tsuTrq_qual is constant 2f
       a value of 0f was observed briefly during failure instant
    E) refMotTrq: post processing of data has shown that refMotTrq
       allows the interpretation of reference motor torque.
       refMotTrq closely correlates to the demanded torque
       as commanded by {@link SteerPutEvent}. Due to communication,
       there is a time delay until the demanded torque is considered
       as "reference" by the steering actuator.
    F) estMotTrq: when the device {@link #isActive()} then the difference
       between "estMotTrq - refMotTrq" is typically small.
       When the torque command is disabled, the value estMotTrq
       takes an arbitrary value that should be ignored.
    G) estMotTrq_qual: {@link SteerPutEvent} commands the steer actuator
       to be passive or active. In passive mode, no torque is applied by 
       the device.
       - estMotTrq_Qual == 0.0 means the device was not in operation since
       power on, or has insufficient supply power, or has another issue.
       - estMotTrq_Qual == 1.0 means the device is passive
       - estMotTrq_Qual == 2.0 means the device is active, and then
         the difference "refMotTrq - estMotTrq" should be small.
         in autonomous mode, estMotTrq_Qual should always be 2.0
    H) gcpRelRckPos: angular position relative to fixed but initially 
       unknown offset
    I) gcpRelRckQual is constant 2f during nominal conditions
       when a failure occurs the value is constant 1f
    J) gearRat is constant 22f, a value of 0f was observed briefly
       during failure instant
    H) halfRckPos is constant 72f, a value of 0f was observed briefly
       during failure instant
